# Fialucci: Proof of Escrow (PoE) and Escrow-First Design

> Temp whitepaper content for demonstration purposes. This file is markdown-rendered by the site. Contributors may replace sections incrementally.

## Abstract
Fialucci introduces an escrow-first paradigm: all value movement is conditional until verifiable proofs satisfy release criteria. Proof of Escrow (PoE) extends consensus to the validation of escrow conditions, enabling deterministic settlement flows across on-chain and off-chain domains.

## Motivation
Value transfer today often depends on trust layers, intermediaries, or post-fact dispute resolution. By treating escrow as a base-layer primitive, Fialucci reduces ambiguity: funds are programmatically locked, condition evaluation is transparent, and settlement is automatic.

## Core Concepts
1. **Native Escrow Objects**: First-class protocol entities with state transitions (LOCKED → PROVEN → RELEASED / REVERTED).
2. **Proof of Escrow (PoE)**: Validator set reaches consensus on the truth of escrow conditions, not merely block ordering.
3. **Modular Oracles**: Pluggable data attestations (market data, IoT, identity, events) with cryptographic accountability.
4. **Deterministic Settlement**: Once a condition set is proven, funds disburse atomically—no manual intervention.

## Lifecycle
```
CREATE -> LOCK -> ATTEST -> VERIFY -> CONSENSUS(PoE) -> SETTLE
```
Each phase is auditable; failure paths revert locked value or re-queue verification attempts.

## Economic Model (Preview)
- Escrow fees reward validators performing condition verification.
- Oracle staking ensures honest attestations; slashing penalizes misreports.
- PoE finality extends block finality with condition truth finality.

## Example Use Cases
- Parametric insurance payout after verifiable weather event.
- Marketplace release post delivery scan + GPS proof.
- Performance-based grants once milestone hashes anchor on-chain.

## Security Considerations
- Oracle integrity and anti-collusion measures.
- Multi-source attestation aggregation.
- Formal verification of escrow state machines.

## Roadmap (High-Level)
| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Alpha | Core escrow objects | Internal testnet |
| Beta  | Oracle modules & PoE tuning | Public testnet |
| GA    | Economic parameters & audits | Mainnet launch |
